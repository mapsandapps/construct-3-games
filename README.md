# My Construct 3 Games Monorepo

Note: these games were all created using Construct 3. The code isn't really meant to be human-readable, but rather to be opened in the visual editor. You can open the projects by visiting the [Construct editor](https://editor.construct.net/). You will need a Chromium browser (Chrome, latest Edge, etc.) to view them because I'm using [folder-based saves](https://www.construct.net/en/blogs/construct-official-blog-1/local-file-folder-saves-1555). Since I'm using the paid version of Construct and often surpassing the limits of the free version, you may not be able to make certain changes to the code if you're using the free version.
